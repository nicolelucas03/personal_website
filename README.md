### About :wave: 
Hi, I'm Nicole Lucas, and this is my personal website, a space where I introduce myself, share my background, and showcase projects I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The site was designed and coded from scratch to reflect my personality, design preferences, and growing skills as a front-end web developer. It also serves as a portfolio hub for future opportunities and collaborations.

### Tech Stack :computer: 
* **HTML**- for structure and semantic markup
- **CSS3**- for styling, layout, and responsive layout
- **JavaScript**- for interactively and dynamic behavior

### Key Section :file_folder: 
* **Home**- Brief introduction and welcome message
- **Projects**- A curated selection of web projects, each with links and descriptions
- **About Me**- My background, interests, and what I am currently learning
- **Contact**- Email link and other contact details using API fetching

### Live Wesbite :rocket: 
You can view the live version of my [website](www.nicolecindylucas.com) here deployed using Netlify  

### What I Learned :brain: 
* Structuring multi-page websites using semantic HTML
- Writing responsive CSS layout with Flexbox and media queries
- Adding simple JavaScript for interactivity (like smooth scrolling and menu toggles)
- Thinking through user experience and content hierarchy

### Future Improvements :pushpin: 
* Add animations and transitions for a smoother user experience
- Optimize performance and loading times
- Implement dark mode toggle and theme switching
- THIS IS A WORK CONSTANTLY IN PROGRESS AS I CONTINUE MY DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY :smile:
