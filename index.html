                    Hi, I'm Nicole Lucas- a computer science graduate with a passion for human-centered design.
                    My journey into tech began in high school, sparked by a love for robotics. In my first year of college, I discovered an interest in how thoughtful design shapes technology, leading me to pursue a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction. With a strong foundation in both programming and design, I’m driven by curiosity and a constant desire to learn and create technology that truly serves people.<br> <br>
                    Outside of tech, you will often find me running races, reading novels, or trying out a new hobby. These moments keep me energized, grounded, and inspired.

                                <p>This app introduces mindfulness through personalized event recommendations based on user preferences gathered during onboarding. Users can sync events to their calendars and explore local experiences tailored to their interests, prompting accessibility and mental well-being. On the back end, organizers can create and manage events, monitor participant engagement, and access analytics to improve retention. SoulSync bridges the gap between those seeking mindfulness and those providing it - through thoughtful design and streamlined interaction.</p>

                                <p id="caption">A privacy-conscious research project exploring the use of mouse behavior for biometric user identification</p>
                                <p>This project investigated whether users can be uniquely identified through their mouse movement patterns. We collected raw mouse data from the browser, processed it to reduce noise, and engineered features such as cursor speed, hesitation time, and pathing behavior. By applying clustering and classification models, we assessed the viability of mouse-based tracking as a privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods like cookies or IP addresses.</p>

From precise dimensioning to rendering and motion studies, these designs reflect an iterative design process rooted in functionality and form. Each project demonstrates attention to detail, spatial reasoning, and a passion for translating ideas into manufacturable components — skills essential to both engineering and product design workflows.</p>
